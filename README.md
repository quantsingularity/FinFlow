## 🏗️ Architecture

FinFlow is built on a modern microservices architecture, ensuring modularity, scalability, and resilience.

### Service Architecture

The platform is composed of several independent backend services, each responsible for a specific business domain:

| Service                | Primary Function                                                     |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Auth Service**       | User authentication, authorization, and session management.          |
| **Payments Service**   | Payment processing, gateway integration, and transaction handling.   |
| **Accounting Service** | Double-entry accounting, ledger management, and financial reporting. |
| **Analytics Service**  | Data analysis, metrics calculation, and visualization.               |
| **Credit Engine**      | Credit scoring, loan application processing, and risk assessment.    |

### Infrastructure Components

The services are supported by a robust infrastructure layer:

| Component            | Function                                                                                             |
| :------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API Gateway**      | Handles request routing, load balancing, and composition.                                            |
| **Service Mesh**     | Manages inter-service communication, security, and observability.                                    |
